        <h3 class="text-primary">Why Solar Time?</h3>
        <p>People first started keeping time with the sun. The careful observer noticed there was a place between the time the sun came up and the time the sun went down when it was highest in the sky. This place also evenly divided the daylight hours into two. And it happened in the same direction each day. It was a time which came to be known as Solar Noon, and it always happened in the direction we now know as South.</p>

        <p>Today, the world is divided into time zones. Because time zones cover a large area, Noon is rarely Solar Noon.</p>

        <p>Perhaps you want to be different. Perhaps you want to go back to a more primitive time (pun intended). A time when noon is actually half way through the day.</p>

        <p>That's what we are about here. Syncing to a time no one else is using, because, well, we can.</p>
